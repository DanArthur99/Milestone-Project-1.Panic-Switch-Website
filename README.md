## Project Goal

Since our band does not currently have a live website, it was my idea to begin developing one.

The end goal was to have a fully functional (front-end) and aesthetically pleasing webpage that showcases our band, music, as well as good user interaction. This would including appropriate theming and imagery that matches the theme of the band, as well as links, both external and embedded, to our our music. 

I also thought it would be a good idea to add a sign up page that would sign users up to a (as of yet) fictional newsletter with their name, email and country. In turn, this would send them emails about upcoming gigs, new music, etc. (Please not that only the front end aspect of this section is functional. The sign up page at this point exists more as a proof of concept).

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### Typography

The Website primarily uses 2 different fonts throughout. Both of which were obtained from Google Fonts. These fonts were:

* Rubik Glitch ('fantasy')
* Exo 2 ('sans-serif')

"Rubik Glitch" is a much more decorative font, so this was typically used for large headings, navigation links, and other large text.

"Exo 2" is a simpler font and is a bit easier to read, so this was generally used for larger paragraphs of text, such as the text on the 'About' page, and descriptive labels.

#### Colour Palette

Keeping in line with the theme of the band, the site uses a largely "colourless" palette , consisting predominantly of blacks, greys, and whites. There are a few exceptions however, such as the navbar elements and the footer elements, which use shades of blue and green, albiet slightly washed shades.

### Lighthouse Testing

#### Home Page

![Home Page Lighthouse Test](docs/testing/index-page-lighthouse-test.png)

* The main issue I am getting from the lighthouse test is performance issues, which is in part due to the embedded youtube video (iframe) that has to load in, as well the numerous animations on the page. When I originally tested the page on the lighthouse test, I was getting scores in the 30s. To fix this issue, I used code from a repository called Lite-YouTube-Embed, written by paulirish ([see Credits section](#Credits)), which allows the page to 'lazy-load' the embedded youtube video, and only loads in the iframe when the 'facade' is clicked.
* Other issues I was getting were due to image file sizes. In the end, I ended up converting all jpg images into webp format, then further compressing them so that the file sizes were not too big.

#### About Page

![About Page Lighthouse Test](docs/testing/about-page-lighthouse-test.png)

#### Shows Page

* The performance for the shows page is scoring slightly lower. The largest contentful paint element is in part to blame, wh

#### Thank You Page

* The only reason the best accessibility section is scoring lower is because of the meta refresh redirect tag. This is intentional, as I wanted the user to be redirected to the homepage once 'signing up.'

### Wave Accessibility Testing

#### Home Page

![Home Page Wave Test](docs/testing/index-page-wave-accessibility.png)

  * While no errors occurred, there is an alert for a redundant link. This however is intentional, as it is my design choice to have the band logo double as a link back to the home page no matter what page the user is on (the only exceptions to this are the thank you page and the 404 page).

![Redundant Link](docs/testing/redundant-link-image.png)

#### About Page

![About Page Wave Test](docs/testing/about-page-wave-accessibility.png)

  * Once again there are alerts for redundant links. However, this is part of my design choice.

![Redundant Links](docs/testing/two-redundant-links-image.png)

#### Shows Page

![Shows Page Wave Test](docs/testing/shows-page-wave-accessibility.png)

  * As before, the redundant links alerts also appear.

#### Sign Up Page

![Sign Up Page Wave Test](docs/testing/sign-up-wave-accessibility.png)

  * Same redundant links alerts as previous.

![Redundant Links](docs/testing/two-redundant-links-image.png)

#### Thank You Page

![Thank You Page Wave Test](docs/testing/thank-you-wave-accessibility.png)
  * As with the lighthouse testing, the only reason an error is occuring is because of the meta refresh redirect tag, which is an intentional design choice of mine, as I wanted the user to be redirected to the home page.
